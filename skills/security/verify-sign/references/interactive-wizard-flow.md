# Artifact Verification — Interactive Wizard

Use with `/verify-sign` **Interaction model**. Each phase = **one** `AskQuestion` (or one free-text
prompt) per assistant turn.

## Progress breadcrumb

`Pipeline · Placement · Source · Details · Verify · Submit`

---

## Phase 0 — Pipeline readiness

**AskQuestion title:** `Verify Sign — pipeline`

| Option id | Label |
|-----------|--------|
| `has_url` | Yes, I have the pipeline ID/URL |
| `need_help` | Not yet — help me find it |

---

## Phase 1 — Pipeline URL

Ask in prose for pipeline URL or id (+ org/project). Then `harness_get`.

---

## Phase 2 — Show pipeline structure (no question)

Call out:

- Existing `SscaArtifactSigning` / `SscaArtifactVerification` steps
- Stage types: `CI`, `Deployment`, `Security`
- Connectors and image from signing step
- If **multiple** `SscaArtifactSigning` steps, list each with identifier, image, and signing method

If **no** `SscaArtifactSigning` exists, warn that the artifact must be signed (`/sign-artifact`)
before verification can succeed. Note whether existing signing steps have `uploadSignature.upload: true`.

For **Deployment** stages, label step groups as **containerized** or **not**.

**CI-only + CD verify:** CD verification is supported — Phase 3b can add a Deploy stage.

---

## Phase 3 — Placement

**AskQuestion title:** `Placement`

| Option id | Label | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `after_signing` | CI — right after Artifact Signing (Recommended) | Same stage as `artifactsigning` |
| `cd_before_deploy` | CD — before deploy in containerized group | Existing or new Deploy stage |
| `add_cd_stage` | Add new CD Deploy stage with verification before deploy | CI-only → Phase 3b |
| `ci_and_cd` | Keep CI verification and add CD verification | When both gates needed |
| `security_end` | Security stage — end | Pre-built registry images |

If `cd_before_deploy` / `add_cd_stage` with no Deploy stage → **Phase 3b**.

Full CD rules: `references/cd-containerized-step-group.md`.

---

## Phase 3b — CD prerequisites

One topic per turn: service → environment → infrastructure → step group K8s connector + namespace.

Append Deploy stage with containerized group containing `SscaArtifactVerification` before
`K8sRollingDeploy`.

### Infrastructure — list ALL (never one environment only)

`harness_list(resource_type="infrastructure")` **requires** `filters.environment_id` — a project-wide
list without it fails. To show the complete inventory:

1. `harness_list(resource_type="environment", org_id, project_id, size=100)`
2. For **each** environment, `harness_list(resource_type="infrastructure", filters={environment_id:
   "<env>"}, size=100, compact=false)`
3. Present **all** env + infra pairs in `AskQuestion` (group by environment in labels)

Example label: `prod / prodinfra — KubernetesDirect, account.sscsplayacc, ns default`

Do not list infra for only the environment chosen in the previous turn unless the user explicitly
asked to filter.

### Step group K8s connector — list ALL K8sCluster connectors

Same scoped listing as Phase 6 but `filters: { type: "K8sCluster" }` at project, org, and account scope.

---

## Phase 4 — Source

| Option id | Label |
|-----------|--------|
| `infer_from_signing` | Same source as Artifact Signing step (Recommended) |
| `third_party` | Pick Third-Party registry |
| `har` | Harness Artifact Registry (HAR) |
| `local` | Harness Local Stage |

Always include **HAR** when offering source tiles.

When inferring, copy signing `source` unchanged (same lowercase types and `image` field).

If **multiple** signing steps exist, **AskQuestion** which step to mirror:

| Option id | Label |
|-----------|--------|
| `<signing_step_identifier>` | `<step_name>` — `<image>` |

---

## Phase 5 — Registry provider (Third-Party only)

| Option id | Label |
|-----------|--------|
| `docker` | Docker Registry |
| `ecr` | Amazon ECR |
| `gcr` | Google GCR |
| `gar` | Google GAR |
| `acr` | Azure ACR |

---

## Phase 6 — Connector

Skip if obvious from `SscaArtifactSigning` or build/push steps.

When asking, follow **the same mandatory connector listing rules as `/sign-artifact` Phase 6**:
`harness_list` + `filters.type` (map provider → `DockerRegistry`, `Aws`, `Gcp`, `Azure`), query
project + org + account scopes, `size: 100`, paginate, present **every** connector in `AskQuestion`.
Never use `params.filterType`, `harness_search`, or a manual subset from an unfiltered list.

---

## Phase 7 — Image / artifact

Free text; default from signing step. **Never guess tags.**

For CD: **default to** `<+artifact.image>` expression. Only offer static signing image as an explicit
alternative; warn when it differs from the service primary artifact tag.

| Option id | Label |
|-----------|--------|
| `artifact_expression` | `<+artifact.image>` — from CD service artifact **(Recommended for Deploy)** |
| `signing_image` | Same static image as signing step — warn if ≠ service default tag |
| `custom` | Custom — I'll provide the full image reference |

## Phase 8 — Verify signature

**AskQuestion title:** `Verify signature`

| Option id | Label |
|-----------|--------|
| `verify_keyless_harness` | Verify — Keyless — Harness OIDC (Recommended when signing used keyless) |
| `verify_keybased` | Verify — Key-based (public key file secret) |
| `verify_vault` | Verify — Secret Manager (Vault public key path) |

If **keybased**, next turn: public key secret id (e.g. `account.cosign_public_key`).

If **vault**, next turn: Vault connector identifier + public key path in Vault.

**Must match** upstream signing method.

---

## Phase 9 — Submit

Summary + confirm `harness_update`.

On `confirm` → insert step, `harness_update`, then provide configuration summary.

**Do not** call `harness_execute` or monitor executions — direct the user to `/run-pipeline`.

---

## Defaults shortcut

- Infer source from `SscaArtifactSigning`
- Verify keyless Harness OIDC (or public key if signing was keybased)
- Placement: after signing step
